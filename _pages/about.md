Yoshihiko is an assistant professor at the University of Tokyo. Currently, he is working on the analysis and method development of single-cell omics data at the University of Tokyo (PI: [Dr. Yukinori Okada](http://www.sg.med.osaka-u.ac.jp/)). He got a degree of M.D. from the University of Tokyo.
During his time as a medical student, he conducted research on the thymic selection of T cells and autoimmunity (PI: Dr. Hiroshi Takayanagi), engaging in both wet and dry experiments (Tomofuji Y et al. Nat. Immunol. 2020).
Following two years of clinical training, he started Ph.D. training under Dr. Yukinori Okada at Osaka University, focusing on bioinformatics research related to the gut microbiome and human genetics (Tomofuji Y et al. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2021/2022, Tomofuji Y et al. Cell Genom. 2022, Tomofuji Y et al. Nat. Microbiol. 2023, Tomofuji Y et al. Cell Rep. in Press). He always loves to uncover the hidden treasures in omics data through the development of new methods.

## Research interests

- Integrative analysis of the single-cell omics data and genome data for immune cells. In addition to the conventional functional genomics approaches such as pseudobulk eQTL mapping, I am specifically interested in the development of new methods to uncover hidden biology in the omics data.
  - Evaluation of the escape from X chromosome inactivation (Tomofuji Y et al. bioRxiv. 2023; co-correspondence; [Github URL](https://github.com/ytomofuji/scLinaX))

- Analysis of the gut microbiome using metagenome shotgun sequencing. I am specifically interested in autoimmune diseases, Japanese-specific gut microbes, and integrative analysis with human genome data.
  - Gut microbiome analysis of the SLE patients ([Tomofuji Y et al. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2021](https://ard.bmj.com/content/80/12/1575.long))
  - Gut virome analysis of the RA/SLE/MS patients ([Tomofuji Y et al. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2022](https://ard.bmj.com/content/81/2/278))
  - Catalogue of the microbes in the Japanese gut ([Tomofuji Y et al. Cell Genom. 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666979X22001720); co-correspondence)
  - Evaluation of the human genome in the metagenome shotgun sequencing data ([Tomofuji Y et al. Nat. Microbiol. 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01381-3; co-correspondence))
  - Integrative analysis of the gut microbiome, human genome, and plasma metabolites (Tomofuji Y et al. Cell Rep. in Press; co-correspondence)
